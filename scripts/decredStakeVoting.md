Decred's unique stake voting system allows users to vote with their coins to reinforce the network, choose the direction of its evolution, and earn more coins.

To participate in the proof-of-stake mining system, users lock a portion of their coins in exchange for a ticket. Once their ticket votes, their locked coins become spendable and they receive new minted coins as reward. 

Tickets are chosen to vote randomly using arbitrary entropy generated by the blockchain.

When a ticket is called to vote, it must respond quickly. It is possible to solo stake tickets but solo stakers usually maintain a number of servers to ensure up-time. Many ticket holders use instead stakepools for this purpose. Stakepools collect a small share of the voting reward in exchange for providing the infrastructure to ensure reliable voting. The use of stakepools is integrated in the Decrediton wallet, making it easy to vote this way.

Stake votes are integral to the integrity of the Decred network. 

The votes in each new block determine the validity of the previous one. If the previous block is deemed invalid, the transactions and miner portion of the block reward are stripped from the network. Stake voters, on the other hand, always receive their portion of the reward, whether they deem a block valid or not. 

This way, stakeholders are compensated for stopping miner attacks and preventing unwanted chain forks.

Decisions regarding consensus rule changes and network updates are also made through stake votes. This is how the rules were updated to make the ticket pricing algorithm more efficient, how the network will be upgraded to perform lightning transactions, and how block size could be changed.

What's more, cryptographic ticket "receipts" are used to verify ticket holders and allow them to interface with Politeia; Decred's chain-anchored proposal system. Through Politeia, users can participate in Decred self-governance by submitting and voting on proposals on how to spend the development fund.

The returns on investment from stake voting will be different for each individual based on the current ticket price, block reward, and ticket lifetime.

The price of a ticket is automatically adjusted in order to maintain the ideal amount of tickets waiting to be drawn from the ticket pool. If the ticket pool contains more than the optimum 40,960 tickets, the price to purchase a ticket will increase. Conversely, if there are too few tickets in the ticket pool, the price will decrease.

The amount of coins earned per vote is directly proportional to the block reward. Each vote will earn 6% of the total block reward. As the block reward decreases by 1% every 21 days, so does the reward per vote. 

How long it will take for an individual ticket to be drawn is purely up to chance. Statistically, most tickets will be drawn within 5 months, but on average a ticket will only wait for 1 month. 

Based on this information an annual percentage rate of 15% can be expected from stake voting.

Best of all, that 15% comes risk free; staked coins are always unlocked whether your ticket successfully votes, or not.
