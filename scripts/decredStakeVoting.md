Decred's unique proof-of-stake system allows users to vote with their coins to reinforce the network, choose the direction of its evolution, and earn more coins.

To participate in the proof-of-stake voting system, stakeholders lock a portion of their coins in exchange for a ticket. Once their ticket votes, their locked coins become spendable and they receive new minted coins as reward. 

Tickets are chosen to vote randomly using arbitrary entropy generated by the blockchain.

A ticket's votes are cast by the ticket holder's chosen stake server.

Stake servers stand by 24/7 to ensure votes are counted and rewards are earned, serving to eliminate losses due to computer downtime or bad Internet connections. In return, stake servers receive a small portion of the rewards to help cover operational costs.

Ticket holder's votes are essential to the integrity of the Decred network. 

The 5 votes in each new block determine the validity of the previous one. If the previous block is deemed invalid, the transactions and proof-of-work portion of the block reward are stripped from the network. The proof-of-stake portion of the block reward is paid out whether ticket holders deem the previous block valid or not. 

PoS voters are free to reject blocks they seem as invalid and still be rewarded, while PoW miners must comply with the rules set by voters to receive their rewards. This gives PoS voters the power to punish and stop PoW miners misbehavior and prevent unwanted chain forks. 

Decisions regarding consensus rule changes and network updates are also made by PoS voters, in a binding on-chain devision-making system. Through this system stakeholders have already voted to change the ticket pricing algorithm to make it more efficient and to prepare the network for lightning transactions. This system can be used to make any change to the consensus rules that has ticket holder support smoothly, like for example a change to the block size limit.

What's more, cryptographic ticket "receipts" are used to _verify_ ticket holders and allow them to interface with Politeia; Decred's chain-anchored proposal system. Through Politeia, users can participate in Decred self-governance by voting to determine which projects receive funding from the project subsidy wallet.

The return on investment from stake voting will be different for each ticket holder based on the current ticket price, block reward, and luck.

The price of a ticket is automatically adjusted in order to maintain the ideal amount of tickets waiting to be drawn from the ticket pool. If the ticket pool contains more than the optimum 40,960 tickets, the price to purchase a ticket will increase. Conversely, if there are too few tickets in the ticket pool, the price will decrease.

The amount of coins earned per vote is directly proportional to the block reward. Each vote will earn 6% of the total block reward. As the block reward decreases by 1% every 21 days, so does the reward per vote. 

How long it will take for an individual ticket to be drawn is purely up to chance. Statistically, most tickets will be drawn within 5 months, but on average a ticket will only wait for 1 month. 

Based on this information, an annual percentage rate of 15% can be expected from stake voting.

Best of all, that 15% comes risk free; staked coins are always unlocked whether your ticket successfully votes, or not.
