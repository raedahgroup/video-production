# Raedah Group Video Production

The purpose of this repository is to create an open archive of video production efforts aimed at informing the public about how Decred works in a visual format.



## What Types of Videos Are Being Made?

Currently focus is on creating a variety of __motion graphic explainer__ videos. Some __tutorial__ videos as well as __documentary__ style videos are planned for the near future as well.

To see what is currently being worked on and is planned for the future, check out the [open issues](https://github.com/raedahgroup/video-production/issues) and [project board](https://github.com/raedahgroup/video-production/projects/1).



## What Is In This Repo?

#### Pre-Production Materials

All pre-production materials are written in markdown. This includes scripts and storyboards.

Creating storyboards in markdown is tedious, but necessary to allow for easy viewing directly on GitHub. To help with the creation and editing of storyboards in markdown format, [mdh](https://github.com/raedahgroup/video-production/blob/master/mdh) can be used.

#### mdh (markdown helper)

`mdh` is a command line program included in this repo designed to allow quick creation and editing of storyboards as markdown files.

With `mdh` you can easily split, add, and remove markdown table rows all without having to manually update the index column or index specific links and filenames.

Learn more about `mdh` [here](https://github.com/raedahgroup/video-production/docs/mdh.md).

#### progress tracking

All videos are tracked from idea to release as Issues. To see which stage of development a specific video is currently in, check out its corresponding issue.
