## How Decred Is Unique
### Voice Over Script

Decred is a cryptocurrency which builds upon the strengths of Bitcoin. To see how Decred is unique, let's compare the two.

Both Bitcoin and Decred have a 21 million coin supply cap.

Here's where things get interesting.

Bitcoin's mining subsidy is reduced by 50 percent every 4 years as shown by this stepped graph.

Decred reduces its mining subsidy smoothly and gradually by 1% every 21 days as shown by this curve.

New Bitcoin blocks are found and broadcast by proof-of-work miners, who also recieve 100% of the Bitcoin block reward. This gives miners all the power, leaving users without a way to coordinate and change the rules regarding what constitutes a valid block. This leaves open the possibility for hard forks in the chain.

Decred improves on this by utilizing a hybrid proof-of-work - proof-of-stake system. Proof-of-work miners recieve 60% of the Decred block reward for finding blocks, and Proof-of-stake Voters recieve 30% for keeping miners in check.

It works like this:

Every 5 minutes a new Decred block is found by a proof-of-work miner. Contained in each block are 5 votes cast by proof-of-stake voters. These votes are used to check the miner behaviour of the previous block.

If a majority deems the pending block unwanted, the miner is stripped of their portion of the block reward as punishment for breaking the rules.

By allowing the rejection of unwanted blocks Decred's hybrid system serves to stop chain-splits and miner attacks.

The differences don't stop there.

10% of the Decred block reward is placed in the network fund. The network fund makes Decred a self-funded open source project with no need for outside capital or an ICO.

How the network fund is spent is determined by the users. Through the Decred proposal system stakeholders get to vote to determine which community sourced projects recieve funding.

Decred is controlled by the stakeholders. To become a stakeholder go to Decred.org to download Decrediton for your platform and buy Decred on one of the many supporting exchanges.

Decred; Decentralized Credit.
