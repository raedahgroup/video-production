| 1 | ![shot 1](../decredUnique/img/shot_1.svg) | **VO**:<br />Decred builds upon the strengths of Bitcoin to create a community driven cryptocurrency with open governance and sustainable funding for development. To see how Decred achieves this, let's compare it to Bitcoin.<br />**Action**:<br /> Words appear as spoken. | 0:14 |
| 2 | ![shot 2](../decredUnique/img/shot_2.svg) | **VO**:<br />For starters, both Bitcoin and Decred have a 21 million coin supply cap.<br />**Action**:<br /> | 0:19 |
| 3 | ![shot 3](../decredUnique/img/shot_3.svg) | **VO**:<br />Here's where things get interesting. Bitcoin's block reward is reduced by 50 percent every 4 years as shown by this stepped graph.<br />**Action**:<br />Line drawn from left to right. | 0:27 |
| 4 | ![shot 4](../decredUnique/img/shot_4.svg) | **VO**:<br />Decred's block reward is reduced smoothly and gradually by 1% every 21 days as shown by this curve.<br />**Action**:<br /> | 0:36 |
| 5 | ![shot 5](../decredUnique/img/shot_5.svg) | **VO**:<br />New Bitcoin blocks are found and broadcast by proof-of-work miners, who also receive 100% of the Bitcoin block reward. Decred blocks are found and broadcast by proof-of-work miners who only receive part of the Decred block reward. Here's why:<br />**Action**:<br /> | 0:57 |
| 6 | ![shot 6](../decredUnique/img/shot_6.svg) | **VO**:<br />Decred utilizes a hybrid proof-of-work - proof-of-stake protocol | 1:21 |
| 7 | ![shot 7](../decredUnique/img/shot_7.svg) | where 90% of Decred's block reward is split between | 1:21 |
| 8 | ![shot 8](../decredUnique/img/shot_8.svg) | proof-of-work Miners and participating stakeholders called | 1:21 |
| 9 | ![shot 9](../decredUnique/img/shot_9.svg) | Proof-of-stake Voters. | 1:21 |
| 10 | ![shot 10](../decredUnique/img/shot_10.svg) | Miners receive 60% of the total block reward for finding Decred blocks while Voters | 1:21 |
| 11 | ![shot 11](../decredUnique/img/shot_11.svg) | receive 30% for casting on-chain votes. It works like this:<br />**Action**:<br /> PoW/PoS icons appear first, then pie chart with 90 percent wedge highlighted which is then split into 30 - 60. Lines draw out to icon when mentioned. | 1:21 |
| 12 | ![shot 12](../decredUnique/img/shot_12.svg) | **VO**:<br />With each new Decred block | 1:33 |
| 13 | ![shot 13](../decredUnique/img/shot_13.svg) | 5 stakeholders are chosen | 1:33 |
| 14 | ![shot 14](../decredUnique/img/shot_14.svg) | to cast 5 on-chain votes. | 1:33 |
| 15 | ![shot 15](../decredUnique/img/shot_15.svg) | These votes, called block votes, | 1:33 |
| 16 | ![shot 16](../decredUnique/img/shot_16.svg) | are used to decide whether | 1:33 |
| 17 | ![shot 17](../decredUnique/img/shot_17.svg) | to accept or reject | 1:33 |
| 18 | ![shot 18](../decredUnique/img/shot_18.svg) | the previous block.<br />**Action**:<br />Block appears first, then stakeholders, then lines and block votes. | 1:33 |
| 19 | ![shot 19](../decredUnique/img/shot_19.svg) | **VO**:<br />If a majority decides to reject the block, its miner is stripped | 1:41 |
| 20 | ![shot 20](../decredUnique/img/shot_20.svg) | of their portion of the block reward | 1:41 |
| 21 | ![shot 21](../decredUnique/img/shot_21.svg) | as punishment for breaking the rules.<br />**Action**:<br />X appears and line greyed out. | 1:41 |
| 22 | ![shot 22](../decredUnique/img/shot_22.svg) | **VO**:<br />By allowing the rejection of blocks, Decred's hybrid protocol provides a mechanism | 1:53 |
| 23 | ![shot 23](../decredUnique/img/shot_23.svg) | for stakeholders to prevent miner attacks and unwanted hard forks, giving them sovereignty over the Decred chain.<br />**Action**:<br />Three lines draw out from center, outside two are stopped with X's | 1:53 |
| 24 | ![shot 24](../decredUnique/img/shot_24.svg) | **VO**:<br />Since Bitcoin employs a pure Proof-of-work protocol, sovereignty over its chain is firmly in the hands of Bitcoin miners, | 2:07 |
| 25 | ![shot 25](../decredUnique/img/shot_25.svg) | leaving Bitcoin stakeholders powerless. The differences don't stop there.<br />**Action**:<br /> | 2:07 |
| 26 | ![shot 26](../decredUnique/img/shot_26.svg) | **VO**:<br />The remaining 10% of the Decred block reward is placed in the Decred Treasury.<br />**Action**:<br />10% wedge is highlighted. | 2:12 |
| 27 | ![shot 27](../decredUnique/img/shot_27.svg) | **VO**:<br />The Treasury makes Decred a self-funded open source project with no need for outside capital or an ICO. How the funds in the Treasury are spent | 2:26 |
| 28 | ![shot 28](../decredUnique/img/shot_28.svg) | is also determined by participating stakeholders.<br />**Action**:<br />Lines cycle continuously | 2:26 |
| 29 | ![shot 29](../decredUnique/img/shot_29.svg) | **VO**:<br />Through Politeia, the Decred proposal system, anyone can shape the future of Decred | 2:41 |
| 30 | ![shot 30](../decredUnique/img/shot_30.svg) | by proposing new ideas for stakeholder consideration. All proposals must be approved by stakeholders, giving them sovereignty over Decred's development.<br />**Action**:<br />Pi icon appears, then proposals icon, then stakeholder icon. | 2:41 |
| 31 | ![shot 31](../decredUnique/img/shot_31.svg) | **VO**:<br />Decred is a community driven cryptocurrency with open governance and sustainable funding for development.<br />**Action**:<br /> | 2:49 |
